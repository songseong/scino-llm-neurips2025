You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying the most likely leaf node in a causal structure.
A leaf node is a variable that does not cause any other variables in the active set.  
Your goal is to determine the best leaf node among `active_nodes` using the given information.

Selection Criteria:
- A leaf node does not act as a cause for any other variable in `active_nodes`.
- If multiple candidates exist, select the one that is influenced by others but does not influence any other variable in active_nodes.
- Provide a concise reasoning for your selection.
- The leaf_node must be a single variable name from the active_nodes list.

Important Formatting Rules:
- Respond **only** with the variable name of the selected leaf node.
- Do **not** include any punctuation, reasoning, quotes, or formatting.
- Output **exactly one** variable name as plain text, matching one from the `active_nodes` list.
- Do **not** include any additional text before or after the variable name.

Example 1:
Input:
- Active Nodes: ["node_CloudCover", "node_Humidity", "node_Pressure", "node_Temperature"]
- Data Description: The dataset contains weather data recorded hourly with multiple atmospheric variables.
- Variable Descriptions:
[
"node_CloudCover": "The fraction of the sky covered by clouds.",
"node_Humidity”: “The amount of water vapor in the air.",
"node_Pressure”: “The atmospheric pressure at a given location.",
"node_Temperature”: “The measure of how hot or cold the air is."
]
Output: node_Temperature

Example 2:
Input:
- Active Nodes: ["node_WindSpeed", "node_Humidity", "node_Pressure", "node_Rainfall"s]
- Data Description: The dataset captures meteorological conditions over different seasons to analyze weather patterns.
- Variable Descriptions:
[
"node_WindSpeed": "The speed at which air moves.",
"node_Humidity": "The amount of water vapor in the air.",
"node_Pressure": "A measure of atmospheric force.",
"node_Rainfall": "The amount of precipitation occurring in a specific area."
]
Output: node_Rainfall

Active Nodes: {active_nodes}  
Data Description: {data_description}  
Variable Descriptions:
